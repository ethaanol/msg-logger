# extra
you'll find logs in the project directory inside of a `log.txt` file <br>
if you encounter errors, i mean this in the most disrespectful way possible, go f*ck yourself <br>
there sometimes can be a problem when an image is sent causing the message to be empty, just keep this in mind

# why
one reason is to view deleted messages

# format
`LOG ->` represents that the message is a log. 

`[UNRECOGNIZED]` means the guild / server couldn't be identified, this usually happens when the message logged is in dms.

`[SERVER]` server is just a generic name but it basically shows what server / guild the message was logged in.

`[CHANNEL]` do i really need to explain this?

`[USERNAME]` the username of the author of the message logged.
